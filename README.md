**What is this?**

This is a simple demonstration of how to use Node/Express for the Model/Controller. With Pug for static views, and Vue for dynamic components.

Vue components are server side rendered and stored in a specific manner, so they can be prebuilt for dist..

This all runs in ES6 where it can, and CommonJS elsewhere..

This is not the efficient way of running this, for that I will be building a plugin for babel to make it much more efficient, this is just a proof of concept.

Requires:

- node6
- npm
- grunt

**First**
`npm install -g grunt`

**Then**
`npm install`

**Run**
`grunt`
